# Rules API POST data

This module adds a Rules action for posting content to a remote API.

The base of this module was borrowed from the "Rules HTTP Client" project.
See: https://www.drupal.org/project/rules_http_client

Along with a  simple Rules plugin, some extra configs are included for
an API Transaction content type. 

Behind the scene, "drupal_http_request" (curl) is used to
make the HTTP calls, Rules handles the UI to setting you authentication
and header data.

Look for a new Rules action "Rules API POST data" action within your Rules.
